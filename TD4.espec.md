## TD4: Combining RStudio and The Grammar of Graphics (of ggplot2)

Within RStudio, the goal is to employ the grammar of graphics
(ggplot2) to create **one plot** of some data set provided by the
student. The Rmd (R markdown) file should be enriched with an
explanation of the plot. Students can use the examples given during
the class.
