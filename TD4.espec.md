## TD4: Combining RStudio and The Grammar of Graphics (of ggplot2)

Within RStudio, the goal is to employ the grammar of graphics
(ggplot2) to create **one plot** of some data set provided by the
student. The Rmd (R markdown) file should be enriched with an
explanation of the plot. Students can use the examples given during
the class.

1. Installing ggplot2: either through the "Install" button in RStudio, or with this command in the console:
     `install.packages("ggplot2");`

2. Select some data set
   - It can be some data of your choice
   - Or the ones already provided during the course (ping-pong, geophysics application)

3. Create one plot to represent the data
   - Use ggplot2 verbs
   - Write a paragraph describing the plot
